  <h2>Mastering Time Management</h2>
  <p>Time is a valuable resource, but it's easy to feel like there's never enough of it. Mastering time management can help you achieve your goals, reduce stress, and improve your overall quality of life.</p>

  <h3>1. Use the Pomodoro Technique</h3>
  <p>This method involves breaking your work into 25-minute intervals, separated by short breaks. It helps you stay focused and prevents burnout during long work sessions.</p>

  <h3>2. Prioritize Your Tasks</h3>
  <p>Identify your most important tasks and tackle them first. This ensures that you are making progress on your biggest goals, even if you don't get everything done.</p>

  <h3>3. Avoid Multitasking</h3>
  <p>Switching between tasks can actually slow you down. Focus on one task at a time to complete it more efficiently and with fewer errors.</p>

  <h3>4. Set Realistic Goals</h3>
  <p>Be honest about how much you can realistically achieve in a day. Overloading your schedule leads to stress and disappointment.</p>

  <h3>5. Review Your Progress</h3>
  <p>At the end of each day or week, take a few minutes to review what you've accomplished. This helps you stay motivated and adjust your plan as needed.</p>
