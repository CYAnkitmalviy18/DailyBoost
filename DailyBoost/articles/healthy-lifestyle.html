<h2>Healthy Lifestyle for Busy People</h2>
<p>Maintaining health in a busy life is challenging, but small habits can make a big difference. Here’s how to stay healthy without wasting time.</p>

<h3>1. Quick Exercises</h3>
<p>Short workouts and stretches keep energy high. Even 10–15 minutes between tasks helps improve circulation and focus.</p>

<h3>2. Balanced Diet</h3>
<p>Eat nutrient-rich snacks and balanced meals. Stay hydrated and avoid relying on junk food or caffeine alone.</p>

<h3>3. Stress Management</h3>
<p>Meditation, deep breathing, and short breaks reduce stress. Mental clarity improves productivity and mood.</p>

<h3>4. Adequate Sleep</h3>
<p>Ensure 7–8 hours of sleep. Quality rest impacts concentration, memory, and overall health.</p>

<h3>5. Positive Mindset</h3>
<p>Time management, realistic goals, and self-motivation help maintain mental and physical wellness.</p>

<h3>6. Plan Ahead</h3>
