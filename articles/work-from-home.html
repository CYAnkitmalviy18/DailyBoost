<h2>How to Stay Productive Working from Home</h2>
<p>Working remotely can be productive if you have the right setup, routine, and mindset. Here are tips to maximize efficiency and maintain balance.</p>

<h3>1. Dedicated Workspace</h3>
<p>Choose a quiet corner or desk for work. This physical boundary helps your mind switch into “work mode.”</p>

<h3>2. Consistent Routine</h3>
<p>Start work at the same time each day. Dress professionally, plan tasks, and take short breaks to stay energized.</p>

<h3>3. Limit Distractions</h3>
<p>Silence notifications, avoid multitasking, and communicate your schedule to family members.</p>

<h3>4. Use Productivity Tools</h3>
<p>Apps like Trello, Notion, and Asana help track tasks. Time-tracking tools highlight where you spend time and improve focus.</p>

<h3>5. Health & Wellness</h3>
<p>Stand, stretch, and stay hydrated. Incorporate mini workouts and ensure 7–8 hours of sleep to stay sharp.</p>

<h3>6. Stay Connected</h3>
<p>Regular communication with colleagues via chat, calls, or video meetings helps collaboration and reduces isolation.</p>

<h3>7. Reward Yourself</h3>
<p>Celebrate completed tasks to stay motivated. Small rewards boost morale and encourage consistency.</p>

<h3>8. Work-Life Balance</h3>
<p>Define clear work hours, avoid checking emails after hours, and recharge for the next day.</p>
